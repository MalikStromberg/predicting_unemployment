# Content
Losing a job is an involuntary imprinting experience with far-reaching consequences for
the affected people and their families. It is desirable to get a new job quickly but that is
not always feasible. Some unemployed need specific state aid to escape unemployment.
The purpose of this seminar thesis is to derive determinants for long-term unemployment
in Germany and use them as predictors to classify unemployed individuals into
classes of high and low risk of getting long-term unemployed. The model can be applied in
the context of targeting for governmental unemployment assistance. Previous models rely on
logistic regression, whereas this thesis uses a kernel support vector machine and
shows that modern techniques like this can outperform traditional approaches.
